# SIEM-Splunk-Project
I recently built a complete SIEM lab environment from scratch, where I simulated real cyber-attacks and monitored them live using Splunk Cloud. This project helped me understand log ingestion, threat detection, dashboards, SSH brute force analysis, Nmap scan detection, audit logs, firewall logs, and more.
